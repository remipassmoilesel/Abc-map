**About MongoDB 5**

If Mongodb does not start after update, you may need to do the following:

- Create a backup with `mongodump`, in case something goes wrong
- Start a MongoDB 4.4 instance:

```sh
$ git diff

   abc-mongodb:
-    image: 'mongo:5.0.20-focal'
+    image: 'mongo:4.4-focal'

$ docker compose down
$ docker compose up     # Or helm upgrade
```

- Execute this admin command:

```sh
# Replace parameters with correct host, username and password
$ mongo --host localhost:27017 -u admin -p admin --eval 'db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.4" } )'
```

- Then start a MongoDB 5 instance:

```sh
$ git diff

   abc-mongodb:
-    image: 'mongo:4.4-focal'
+    image: 'mongo:5.0.20-focal'

$ docker compose down
$ docker compose up     # Or helm upgrade
```

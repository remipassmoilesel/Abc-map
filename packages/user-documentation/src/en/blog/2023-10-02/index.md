## Introduction

When you use Abc-Map, your current project is automatically saved in your computer's memory.

## How it works ?

Each modification of your project (adding a layer, modifying a geometry, etc.) results in a background save. When you
start Abc-Map, if a project is saved locally then this project is loaded. You can then resume your work.

However, layers that contain a lot of geometry are not automatically saved in order to preserve
the resources of your workstation.

## How do I know if autosave is enabled?

- Open the **Project management** module
- Look at the list of layers, you may see a message telling you that autosave is disabled. If you don't see a message then autosave is enabled.

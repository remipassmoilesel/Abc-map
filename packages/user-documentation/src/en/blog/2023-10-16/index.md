## Introduction

Since October 2023, Stadia Maps is the new provider of [Stamen](https://maps.stamen.com/stadia-partnership/) tiles.

To use these layers, you now need a Stadia API key. Everything is explained in this [blog post](https://abc-map.fr/documentation/en/blog/2023-10-13).

## Impact on projects

Now projects that use these layers will be updated. Stamen layers will be replaced by standard OpenStreetMap layers.

There is now only one predefined layer available (standard OpenStreetMap). But you can still use the **datastore** !

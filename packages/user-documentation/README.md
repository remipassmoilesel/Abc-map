# User documentation

This package contains the user documentation displayed in the documentation page of the web application.

This documentation is built with Eleventy. You can learn more about here:

- https://www.11ty.dev/docs/
- https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog

## About links, medias and URLs

The documentation is displayed in two ways, on a static site and in the main web application. In these two cases, the bases are different. As a result :

- Images, videos, scripts MUST use absolute urls
- Links to application must use relative urls
- External links must start with http:// or https://

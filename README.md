Abc-Map is a geographic information processing tool that is easy to understand and use.

Use cases:

- Education
- Professional uses: tourism, deliveries, ...
- Sports and leisure: hiking, hunting, treasure hunts, ...

You can try Abc-Map online on [abc-map.fr](https://abc-map.fr). If you like it, please give it a star üåü

## Why ?

There are some very good GIS available: [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) and others are great software. But they are
designed by and for experts, and are hard to use.

Abc-Map is a lightweight GIS whose objective is to offer a good user experience for neophytes as for experts in a
hurry.

## What can I do with this thing ?

- You can create and process geographic data (geojson, shapefiles, WMS, WMTS, XYZ, ...)
- You can export maps in PDF or PNG format
- You can share online maps on your sites in iframe or fullscreen
- If you are a nerd you can practice Javascript, Typescript, React, Openlayers and more !

## Who uses Abc-Map ?

- Sportsmen and women for running or cycling routes
- Teachers and students for workshops
- Entrepreneurs to georeference their activities or one-off events
- Police, gendarmes and coastguards for public service missions
- Ecological associations for the organization of community actions
- Professional researchers and enthusiasts to illustrate historical or political narratives
- Tourist offices for tour itineraries
- Town halls and citizens' committees for the organization of markets or celebrations
- Humanitarian and solidarity organizations for social action missions

And much more, which we don't hear about because... we don't track users üëèüëè
